    "These ICS3U Grade 11 Computer Science python coding questions will form a part of your final grade for this course and are to be handed in for grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "For all of the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a Python IDE of your choice (Spyder, IDLE, Pycharm, etc) and create a coded solution to the given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hand in the .py files for your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade will be based on your ability to demonstrate the overall expectations from the Ontario Computer Studies Curriculum\n",

    "A1 – Data Sequencing \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use variables to carry out mathematical calculations in a computational problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- incorporate one dimensional arrays into a computer program\n",
    "\n",
    "A2 – Selection and Repetition Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporate selection structures into a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporate repetition structures into a computer program\n",
