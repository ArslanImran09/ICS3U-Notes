# ICS3U Curriculum - Grade 11 Computer Science Course Outline

ICS3U introduces students to computer science. The ICS3U Curriculum will have Grade 11 Computer Science students design software independently and as part of a team, using industry-standard programming tools and applying the software development life-cycle model. They will also write and use subprograms within computer programs. ICS3U1 students will develop creative solutions for various types of problems as their understanding of the computing environment grows. They will also explore environmental and ergonomic issues, emerging research in computer science, and global career trends in computer-related fields.

Grade 11 Computer Science is about how computers compute.  It is not about learning how to use the computer, and it is much more than computer programming.  Computer studies is the study of ways of representing objects and processes.  It involves defining problems, analyzing problems, designing solutions, and developing, testing, and maintaining programs.  The major focus of the ICS3U Curriculum is the development of programming skills, which are important for success in future postsecondary studies. Introduction to Computer Science is relevant for all students because it incorporates a broad range of transferable problem solving skills and techniques, including logical thinking, creative design, synthesis and evaluation.  It also teaches generically useful skills in areas such as communication, time management, organization, and teamwork.
